# Assembly Endgame

Assembly Endgame is a fun and humorous twist on the classic Hangman game, where each incorrect guess results in the demise of a programming language. The goal is to guess the word before too many programming languages are wiped out, with Assembly being the last language standing in case of failure. The game is complete with comedic text to add some fun when you win or lose!

## How to Play

1. **Guess the Word:** Click on the letters of the alphabet to guess the word.
2. **Avoid Wrong Guesses:** For each wrong guess, a programming language dies.
3. **Win the Game:** Guess all the letters of the word correctly before running out of attempts.
4. **Game Over:** If you reach the max number of wrong guesses, it's game over, and Assembly is the only language left.
5. **New Game:** Click the "New Game" button to play again once the game ends.
